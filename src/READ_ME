Hello, Welcome to my Assignment 0 (SKUNK GAME)

Just run the program from main to play the game.

This Game consists of a "SKUNKGame.java" that sets up the game by calling its super class "Game.java", and by user-input prompts for
customizing the game setting.

Once the game is set up, the game will "start()" from a method call in the "Main.java". The Game runs off of 5 rounds, and for each round
if conditions are met, the round will end and a new "round()" will start.

Once the last round ends. The winner is announced, and you can restart the game with the same settings if you wish.
